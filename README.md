## ✨ Features

- 🌀 **Quantum-Inspired Branching** – Story paths exist in superposition until chosen.
- 🎭 **Genre-Based Generation** – Create narratives across multiple genres (Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Mystery, etc.).
- 🎮 **Interactive Choices** – Select from multiple possible futures or craft your own.
- 🔗 **Quantum Entanglement Control** – Adjust how interconnected story paths become.
- 🔄 **Fallback Mechanisms** – Ensures continuity even when API limits are reached.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.8+**
- **Google AI API key** (Gemini model access required)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/iamr7d/quadai.git
cd quadai

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv quantum_story_env

# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
quantum_story_env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source quantum_story_env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

```bash
streamlit run quode_ai.py
```
Then, open your browser and navigate to: **[http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)**

## 🧪 How It Works

QuadAI leverages quantum computing principles to create dynamic, non-linear storytelling experiences:

- **Superposition** – Multiple story possibilities exist simultaneously until a choice is made.
- **Quantum Weights** – Each path has a probability determined by quantum-inspired algorithms.
- **Collapse** – Selecting a path "collapses" the quantum state, influencing future options.
- **Entanglement** – Prior choices affect upcoming story branches, creating deep interconnections.
